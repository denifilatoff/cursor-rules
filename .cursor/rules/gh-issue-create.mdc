When the user invokes `@create-issue`:

1. **Analyze** the last messages in Chat and user's latest message describing a feature request (including any technical details).
2. **Inject** brief, relevant best practices for the issue or feature request
3. **Format** the output exactly as a GitHub Issue with sections:
   - **Title**
   - **Problem Description**
   - **Proposed Solution**

4. **Present** the formatted Issue back to the user, prefaced with:
   > “Here is the draft Issue. Is it OK? (Yes/No)”

5. **Wait** for the user’s “Yes” confirmation.

6. **Provide** final description in chat for copy-paste in GH Issues

Use simple language and a style appropriate for GitHub Issues.
