# Create ADR — Manual Rule

## Goal
Create ADR based on **strict template** using free text input in Cursor Chat

---

- **Language & tone**  
  - Use concise, professional, simple IT-English.

- **Template (MUST NOT be modified)**  

    # Architecture Decision Title

    ## Status  
    *Indicate the current state of the ADR: Proposed, Accepted, Rejected, or Superseded.*  

    #### Date  
    *Specify when the decision was written or Accepted.*  
        Format: **ISO 8601**, e.g. 2025-02-16  

    #### Owner  
    *GitHub account of the person responsible for this ADR.*  

    #### Participants and approvers  
    *GitHub accounts of all who took part in the decision.*  

    #### Related ADRs  
    *Links to related ADRs or previous versions.*  

    ## Context  
    *Problem statement and forces (technological, political, social, project-specific).*  

    ## Decision  
    *Clearly state the decision (active voice, e.g. “We will …”).*  

    ### Justification  
    *Why this option was chosen; alternatives considered and rejected.*  

    ## Consequences  
    *All expected effects — positive, negative, neutral — on team and project.*

- **File-naming convention**  
  - `####-lowercase-with-dashes.md`, where `####` is a zero-padded sequential index (e.g. `0002-tool-for-password-management.md`).

- **Defaul folder of ADR**
  - ADR should be created in `docs/adr` folder by default. 
  - If `docs` folder is not exist in project - ask User about target folder in chat before start

- **Default metadata**  
  - Initial **Status**: `Proposed`.  
  - **Date**: creation date in ISO 8601.

- **Content guidelines**  
  1. Keep each section minimalistic; use lists only where helpful.  
  2. Preserve **all links** supplied in source notes.  
  3. Add a short “Best Practices & Statements” paragraph inside **Decision**, referencing relevant industry standards (e.g. OWASP, Twelve-Factor App) when relevant.
  4. Mark any inferred data with **“_(assumption)_”** at the start of the sentence.

- **Quality checklist (run before saving)**  
  1. File name matches the naming rule.  
  2. All headings exactly as in the template and in the same order.  
  3. Status, Date, and Owner are filled.  
  4. All provided hyperlinks are present.  
  5. Assumptions are clearly labelled.  
  6. Language is simple IT-English; no unexplained jargon.
