Manual rule – invoke with @examples-import.

# Examples Import — Manual Rule

## Goal
Make every **non-Markdown** example in the repo readable in the generated MkDocs site **without duplicating code**.

---

## Detection rules

* Treat folders named *examples*, *samples* or *demos* (case-insensitive) as example roots.  
* **Skip** an example folder if it is  
  a) outside the repo root **and**  
  b) outside `docs/`.  
  (Ignore anything inside `third_party/`, `.venv/`, etc.)

---

## Processing steps

1. **Relocate folders with examples**  
	- If an example folder is in the repo root, move it to `docs/examples/<same-name>`.

2. **Propose logical groups**  
	- Default grouping = first-level sub-folders (or file type if flat).  
	- Present the groups and their files; **get user confirmation**.

3. **Create one NEW page per group**  
	- For each group of examples, create a separate file where we use mkdocs to display content directly on the page, adding concise headers and explanations when necessary.
    - *Use `--8<--` embed; **never** copy the code.* (https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/code-blocks/?h=code+blo#embedding-external-files)

4. **Build an index page**
	Create a separate Markdown file - an index, with links to the examples we created in the previous step. The index should also have a general description of the examples so users understand whether to visit them or not.

5. **Update navigation**
	Include the resulting MD documents in navigation. (`nav` chapter in `mkdocs.yml`)

6. **Lint pass**
   • Run `mkdocs build --verbose --strict`.  
   • Fix new warnings (broken paths, duplicate headings, etc.).  
   • If issues remain, list them and agree with the maintainer before skipping.
